# Advanced Linear Regression Assignment: Predicting Real Estate Prices

## Objective
Predict the price of real estate properties based on various features using linear regression. Further, understand and mitigate potential issues related to linear regression.

## Data
Use any real estate dataset with at least 15 features. You can consider datasets from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other source. Ensure the dataset has at least 10,000 observations for complexity.

## Tasks

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. Visualize the distribution of the target variable (property price).
2. Identify and treat outliers.
3. Visualize relationships between the target variable and each of the predictors.
4. Conduct correlation analysis and identify potential multicollinearity issues.

### Data Preprocessing:

1. Handle missing values.
2. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
3. Normalize/Standardize the features.

### Feature Engineering and Selection:

1. Create polynomial features for at least three predictors and evaluate their relationship with the target.
2. Use techniques like backward elimination, forward selection, or LASSO to select the most relevant features.

### Model Development:

1. Split the data into training and test sets.
2. Build the linear regression model on the training set.
3. Validate the model on the test set and compute metrics like RMSE, R^2, and adjusted R^2.

### Model Diagnostics:

1. Check for the assumptions of linear regression:
   - Linearity
   - Independence
   - Homoscedasticity
   - Normality of residuals
   - No multicollinearity
2. Use plots like residual vs. fitted values, QQ plot, etc., for diagnostics.

### Model Refinement:

1. If the assumptions are violated, consider techniques to remedy them. For instance:
   - Apply a different transformation to the target variable (e.g., log transformation) if its relationship with predictors is non-linear.
   - Use weighted least squares if heteroscedasticity is present.
   - Consider adding/removing features or interactions if multicollinearity is detected.

### Regularization:

1. Implement Ridge and Lasso regression.
2. Compare their performance with the standard linear regression model. Discuss the benefits and limitations of each.

### Model Interpretation:

1. Interpret the coefficients of the final model.
2. Discuss the practical implications of your findings for a real estate investor.

### Bonus:

1. Use other regression algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, and compare their performance with the linear regression model.
2. Implement a simple web application where users can input property features and get a predicted price.
